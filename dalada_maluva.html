        The circular building of Dalada Maluwa, also known as Terrace of the Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha, is a beautiful work of art and architecture of the 12th century. Dalada Maluwa was built by King Parakrambahu the great (1164-1196AD), it was later enhanced and decorated by King Nissankamalla (1198-1206). 
        It was the intended house for the Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha; however, presently, the Tooth Relic is deposited in Kandy Tooth Relic Temple.
        As the capital of the Kandyan kingdom, Kandy which is 3 hours away from Dalada Maluva had become home to the relic of the tooth of Lord Buddha, and the protector of the relic was the ruler of the land. The Royal Palace and the Temple of the Tooth were thus placed near each other.
        The existing rock arts and moonstones are serene. Dalada Maluwa was an attraction for Buddhist Vihar in the glory days and stood as an epitome of a glorious history.
        An important festival and significant tourist attraction here is the Kandy Esala Perahera which is the procession from Dalada Maluwa to Kandy. Also known as The Festival of the Tooth, it is a grand event celebrated with embellished costumes. It is an annual procession held every year between July and August in honour of The sacred tooth relic of Lord Buddha.
