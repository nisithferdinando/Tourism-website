        This magnificent stupa is situated in Polonnaruwa and is the 4th largest stupa in Sri Lanka. Built by the Nissanka Malla(1187-1196) it is one of the most sought after tourist attractions, i.e. 'dagobas' of the country. Rich in vibrant history and scenic beauty, this place must be on your to-visit list if you come to Sri Lanka.The stupa of Rankoth Vehera is in the centre of a large square terrace. There are four entrances to the yard with four cardinal points.

Located in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka, Rankoth Vehera's design was inspired by thtraditional stupas in Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya and bears a close resemblance to Ruwanwelisaya.

According to a stone inscription found in the vicinity of the stupa, it was initially named as "Ruwanweli Stupa". However, later, it was called Rankoth Vehera and had a circumference of 200m initially.

Located in the centre of a large square terrace,it has four entrances to the yard with four cardinal points. You can take the sandy path to the stupa for a walk, the peaceful atmosphere, which is a common factor at every temple here, can relax your mind for a while.
Both local and foreign travellers visit the Rankoth Vehera daily and engage with rituals without considering their born religious background. At the same time, you can know more about the murals and frescoes in the image house from the chief incumbent in the temple.
